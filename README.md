# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python script that uses Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer data from the sklearn dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is included in the `sklearn` library. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. Each sample has 30 features that describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
